# Student-Marks-Prediction
The main goal of the project is to analyze the correlation between chosen input features and the marks scored by students. With this analysis, we aim to develop a predictive model that estimates how well a student is likely to perform academically.

In this project, we implemented a Linear Regression model to predict student marks based on key input features derived from a dataset containing various parameters related to student performance. The model was trained to understand how these features correlate with the scores achieved by students.

After training and validating the model, we evaluated its performance using the following metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): 6.7175
This metric indicates the average squared difference between the predicted and actual marks. A lower MSE suggests better predictive accuracy.

R-squared (R²): 0.5777
This value indicates that approximately 57.77% of the variance in student marks can be explained by the input features used in the model. While this shows some correlation, there is still room for improvement in the model's predictive power.

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 1.3006
This metric reflects the average absolute difference between the predicted marks and the actual marks, providing a clear understanding of the model’s prediction errors.

These metrics provide insight into the effectiveness of our predictive model and identify areas for further optimization, such as exploring more complex algorithms or including additional features for better accuracy.
