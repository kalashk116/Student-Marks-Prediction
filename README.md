# Student-Marks-Prediction
The main goal of the project is to analyze the correlation between chosen input features and the marks scored by students. With this analysis, we aim to develop a predictive model that estimates how well a student is likely to perform academically.

In this project, we implemented a Linear Regression model to predict student marks based on key input features derived from a dataset containing various parameters related to student performance. The model was trained to understand how these features correlate with the scores achieved by students.

After training and validating the model, we evaluated its performance using the following metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): 6.7175
R-squared (RÂ²): 0.5777
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 1.3006

These metrics provide insight into the effectiveness of our predictive model and identify areas for further optimization, such as exploring more complex algorithms or including additional features for better accuracy.

NOTE !!!
= This model had 13 columns and 6000 rows,  the model had above results. If amount of data is increased and linear regression model is trained on more data, the outputs may improve !!
